# ExcelMacro

Invoke excel macros from the commandline

## Powershell

Adapted from [Calling Excel macros from PowerShell with arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19536241/calling-excel-macros-from-powershell-with-arguments) and [Modify range of Hyperlinks in Excel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39238101/modify-range-of-hyperlinks-in-excel). Besides, [How to export a csv to excel using powershell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17688468/how-to-export-a-csv-to-excel-using-powershell) could be another approach.

## Go

Provided you got installed [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and related library [Excelize](https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize), working with XLSX might be simplified, i.e. [hyperlinks](https://xuri.me/excelize/en/cell.html#GetCellHyperLink).
